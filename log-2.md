### Day 1: 05 January 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Basic HTML and HTML5 section on freeCodeCamp and most of the Basic CSS section.

**Thoughts:** This was a good brush up on my HTML and CSS skills. This is a different way of learning than using Treehouse. I'm excited to work through more of the freeCodeCamp curriculum.
