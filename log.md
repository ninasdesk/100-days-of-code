# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 20 August 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked through the JavaScript Basics course on Treehouse.

**Thoughts:** Today is my first day learning about JavaScript, so I am on the beginner's course. I've learned a lot already and have even written some alert commands. I've also learned better ways to explain things (running/executing the program, syntaxt, etc.).
